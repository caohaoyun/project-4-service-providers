# Project 4: East Coast House Price Prediction

Our project and learning model is focusing on analysis of house pricing in different cities of the US. We are curious about questions such as: 
 - what factors will affect pricing the most?

- does the most important factor differentiate in different cities?

- Which city has the most reasonable and stable pricing model?

Factors that we going to analyze towards house pricing:
- bed (# of beds)
- bath (# of bathrooms)
- acre_lot (Property / Land size in acres)
- city (city name)
- state (state name)
- position (area)
- living space (in square feet)

We found an amazing database that gave a large amount of data about all the factors and pricing for houses in different cities in US. The link is attached below:
